# Async and Isolate in Flutter

 ### Flutter Async vs. Isolate: Performance Comparison App 🚀

This Flutter mobile app demonstrates the difference between async-await (single-threaded concurrency) and Isolates (multi-threaded parallelism) in Dart.

### Key Differences:
🔹 **Async-await:** Runs on the main thread, allowing non-blocking execution but sharing resources with UI updates. Ideal for network requests and database operations.
🔹 **Isolate:** Runs on a separate thread, enabling parallel execution without blocking the UI. Best for CPU-intensive tasks like image processing or complex calculations.
